# Getting Started with React Aria-Able Frontend Site

This project was built from scratch from a empty folder to then using a huge range of amazing tools. Along the way learning these tools and seeing how they all click together was the most satisfying part of the project!

## React (17.10) & React Router

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm run dev`

Bundled all my code into a minified folder with no whitespace hopefully pushing it into the kilobytes!

Runs the app in the development mode built and shipped via Parcel.\
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser.

## `npm run lint`

Where I run a script that tell me I am making a ton of mistakes and that I need to correct them.
Runs the app with .eslintrc.json

## `npm run format`
